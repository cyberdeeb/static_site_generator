# Build Your Own Static Site Generator

**What I'll Learn**

* **Understand the fundamentals of static site generation.** 
* **Master Markdown processing and conversion to HTML.**
* **Apply object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP) principles to build a robust and maintainable codebase.**
* **Develop skills in parsing and generating both inline and block-level HTML elements.**
* **Combine these skills to create a fully functional static site generator from scratch.**

**Project Overview**

This project will guide me through the creation of a Python-based static site generator. I'll gain hands-on experience with web development concepts and a deeper understanding of how static content management systems work. 

**Chapter List**

1. **Static Sites**
    * **Key Concepts:** Explore the advantages of static sites, such as improved performance, SEO, and security.
    * **Hands-on:** 
        * Process and organize static HTML and Markdown files.
        * Establish the foundational project structure.

2. **Node-Based Architecture**
    * **Key Concepts:** Learn to represent HTML using a node-based system.
    * **Hands-on:**
        * Implement a flexible and maintainable structure using OOP and recursion. 

3. **Inline Elements**
    * **Key Concepts:** Master the parsing of inline Markdown elements (e.g., links, bold, italics).
    * **Hands-on:**
        * Translate Markdown syntax into corresponding HTML tags.

4. **Block-Level Elements**
    * **Key Concepts:** Handle and generate HTML for block-level elements (e.g., headings, lists, code blocks).
    * **Hands-on:** 
        * Combine block-level parsing with node generation for comprehensive HTML output.

5. **Building the Complete Website**
    * **Key Concepts:** Integrate all components into a fully functional static site generator.
    * **Hands-on:**
        * Combine inline and block-level processing logic.
        * Publish my first static website.

**Getting Started**

* **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.8 or higher
    * Understanding of OOP and FP concepts
